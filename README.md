# OrdinoR-Arya
Project Arya is based on [OrdinoR]() for the visualization of
organizational models.
See [here]() for an instruction on how to use it.

Arya is built as a Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web
app, with its core based on the following software:

* [OrdinoR]()

* [pygraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/), for manipulating graph objects

* [d3-graphviz](https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz), for visualization
