# OrdinoR-Arya
Project Arya is based on [OrdinoR](https://ordinor.readthedocs.io/) 
for the visualization of organizational models. See 
[the documentation](https://ordinor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/2021arya.html)
for an instruction on how to use it.

Arya is built as a Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web
app.
